			<p>
		    	Using Canopy for the IDE, Python for the programming language, and Tkinter as a GUI, my partner and I created a program that can encrypt and decrypt messages using a public and private key.  
		    	The public key was available to our peers so they could encrypt messages and send them to Jacob and me.  
		    	Then, with our private key embedded in the program, we decrypted the messages.  
		    	In response, we also inserted other groups' public key into our program, encrypted a unique message and sent it to them to decrypt.
		    	The video shows me inserting a public key into the encryption side, and then typing out a message and saving it to a separate text file.
		    	Then, after encrypting it, I copied the message, and pasted it into the decryption text box.
		    	Pressing the button, the program used our private key to decrypt the message and return it to me.
		    	Overall, it was a fun project with interesting concepts, and it further explored the benefits of Tkinter.
